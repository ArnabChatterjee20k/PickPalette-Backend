![Applying Migration Image](./docs/SupabaseAuthTableReference.jpeg)

- We need to follow this for referencing the auth table
- Auth table is generated automatically by supabase
- We can write all the properties manually in the model but we need to reference that in other tables
- So we can bare minimum schema auth and then inside it a table with a bare minimum fields we require for reference in other table
- Now after the generate command, a sql file will be generated but if we run that we will get error as the auth schema is alread present
- So change this
```
CREATE SCHEMA "auth";
```
To this
```
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS "auth";
```
